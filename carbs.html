	     <h1>Energy giving foods </h1>
	      <p> What’s most important is the type of carbohydrate you choose to eat because some sources are healthier than others.
	          The amount of carbohydrate in the diet – high or low – is less important than the type of carbohydrate in the diet. 
	          For example, healthy, whole grains such as whole wheat bread, rye, barley and quinoa 
	          are better choices than highly refined white bread or French fries.</p>
	      <P style="color:orange"><b>Foods high in carbohydrates include bread, pasta, beans, potatoes, rice, and cereals.</b></p>

	   <h4>Health Benefits </h4>
	    <p>Carbohydrates are found in a wide array of both healthy and unhealthy foods—bread, beans, milk, 
	       popcorn, potatoes, cookies, spaghetti, soft drinks, corn, and cherry pie. They also come in a variety of forms. </p>
	    <p>The most common and abundant forms are sugars, fibers, and starches.</p>
        <p>Foods high in carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet. 
		   Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose, which is converted to energy used to support bodily functions and physical activity. 
		   <b>But carbohydrate quality is important;</b> some types of carbohydrate-rich foods are better than others </p>

        <p>Not getting enough carbs can cause problems. Without sufficient fuel, thebody gets no energy. Additionally,
           without sufficient glucose, the central nervous system suffers, which may cause dizziness or mental and physical
           weakness, according to lowa State University.
		<p style="color:orange"><b>A deficiency of glucose,or low blood sugar, is called hypoglycemia.</b></p>

        <p>If the body has insufficient carbohydrate intake or stores, it will consume proteinfor fuel. 
		   This is problematic because the body needs protein to make muscles.
           Using protein for fuel instead of carbohydrates also puts stress on the kidneys, leading to the passage of painful
           byproducts in the urine, according to the University of Cincinnati.
           People who don't consume enough carbohydrates may also suffer from insufficient fiber, which can cause
           digestive problems and constipation.</p>
