	  <h1>Your Protein needs </h1>
	   <p>Proteins are made up of chains of smaller chemicals called amino acids.
           The human body cannot store amino acids, so it must be supplied daily from the foods we eat.
       </p>
	   <p>Protein makes up the building blocks of organs, muscles, skin, hormones and pretty much everything that matters in your body.
          for this reason, you should eat high-quality protein at every meal.
       </P>
	   <p><b>The amount of protein you need in your diet depends on your weight, age and health. As a rough guide</b>
	    <ul><li> 0.75 g/kg for adult women </li>
		<li> 0.84 g/kg for adult men </li>
		<li> Around 1 g/kg for pregnant and breastfeeding women, and for men and women over 70 years. </li>
		</ul></p>

		 <h1> SOURCES OF PROTEINS: </h1>
	  <ul><li>lean meat, poultry </li><li> fish  and eggs </li>
<li> dairy products like milk, yoghurt and cheese </li>
<li> seeds and nuts </li>
<li>beans and legumes (such as lentils and chickpeas) </li>
<li>soy products like tofu </li>
<li>some grain and cereal-based products are also sources of protein, but are generally not as high in protein as meat and meat alternative products.</li>
